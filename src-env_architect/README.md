# Source - Environment Architect

The Environment Architect can either draw from a database of pre-built environments (machines and network connections), draw from a database of different configurations to apply to environments, or be instructed to build a custom environment.

In order to run the environment architect, run test.py using "./test.py" in the Linux terminal, or the Windows equivalent for running programs in the Python interpreter.
