# Juno

Juno is a system for rapidly deploying practice networks for security attack and defense games. It is comprised of a KVM-based hypervisor, an environment-creation server, and a player-identity management server. These services work together to create and host environments for teams of players to either compromise or keep alive for a specified period of time. Juno aims to reduce the barrier to entry into cybersecurity games.

Juno is a self-proposed project for Oregon State University's undergraduate "capstone" class. Students spend 9 months (three quarters) developing a project to show off the computer science skills they learned during their academic career, as well as practicing real software development in a team setting in preparation for the workforce.
