# Individual Contributions to the Project

## Casey Colley - Project Lead, Primary Point of Communication

### Introduction

By the end of Capstone, I’d like to have worked on and completed a system that takes in settings for the presence of vulnerabilities and outputs virtual machine images that represent an intentionally-vulnerable, interdependent business network. This system is one of the foundational parts of the project, performing most of the work that is necessary to quickly and consistently design networks for Attack and Defense games. This portion of the project is what I personally need for training teams in OSUSEC. 

### User Stories

“As a user, I need a component that will automatically create a vulnerable network of virtual machines for me given some vulnerability settings so that I can get a variety of learning experiences with vulnerabilities.”

“As a user, I need the ability to deploy pre-configured environments instead of creating a new one every time, so that I can practice what I potentially missed on the first experience with the network.”

“As a user, I need the ability to save environment configurations as a constant “image” so that I can deploy them again at a later date.”

“As a developer, I need to be able to keep track of the list of flags per environment, so that I can prove that players in the environment accomplished certain goals to award points.”

### Individual Iteration Plan

Iteration 0:

- Task: Write Python script to receive instructions and send disk images or configuration scripts as appropriate. Write tests accordingly.
- Time required: 1 month, Winter term weeks 1-4


Iteration 1:

- Task: Write a program that receives instructions and sends lists of flags to the Scoreboard. It also sends disk images and lists of flags to the Hypervisor upon receiving instructions. Write tests.
- Time required: 6 weeks, Winter term weeks 5-10


Iteration 2:

- Task: Program also generates and sends config scripts to Hypervisor upon receiving instructions. Write tests.
- Time required: 6 weeks, Winter term Finals Week & Spring term weeks 1-4

Each iteration’s task is dependent on the previous iteration’s work.
