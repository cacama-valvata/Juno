### Introduction

By the end of Capstone, I'd like to have worked on and completed the game server which deals with taking in requests for new games and then spawning virtual machines per the instructions. I would like to refer to the low level work I have done on the game server with creating hypervisors and other such tools on my resume.

### User Stories

User Story 1:
"As a user, I need a way to create virtual machines with a variety of specified vulnerabilities so I can practice attacking and patching them."

User Story 2:
"As a user, I need to automate the creating of virtual machines so I don't need in depth knowledge on how to set them up."
