### Introduction

By the end of the capstone, I would like to have worked on and completed the player identity server, which involves setting up the management of keys and VPN configurations used by players to connect to game environments. I’d like to be able to reference my work on Juno’s config management system on resumes after graduation.

### System Architecture

#### Figure 1:

As a written description of the relationships between the given models, the player’s PC can connect to Juno via a web browser that sets up the requirements for the environment that will eventually be used for an Attack and Defense game. A virtual machine will also be run on the PC that connects with the player information server via SSH keys. The player info servers keep track of the requirements set by players and keep track of games, with the help of the environment architect and the game server. The environment architect keeps track of available environments and doles them out as requested by the info servers, while the game server spawns a child process per game that has been started by the players.


#### Figure 2:

My work in particular will be with setting up the web app authentication and data tracking of the player info servers.

### User Stories
“As a senior project manager, I need to train my security team on the vulnerabilities inherent to programs run on different platforms and operating systems, so that our project will be more resilient to having security vulnerabilities come up both in-production and once it’s released.”

“As a developer with a focus on security, I want to familiarize myself with security vulnerabilities in various environments I may come across in order to better understand these systems, so that I can broaden my knowledge base for future positions or promotions.”

### Iteration Plan and Estimates
It’s most likely that, in iteration, our team is going to start iteration 0 around the beginning of Winter term by putting together a basic prototype made up mostly of adapted and stitched-together open source work. In that period, we will also be spiking any extra information that we need to adapt that open-source work into what we require. It will likely take 3-4 weeks to complete the prototype, and maybe a bit longer for the spike, since what we decide to spike will depend on what we decide we need to add onto the functionality that the prototype provides. From there, we will each spend 4-6 weeks to work on iteration 1, writing our own versions of a lot of the work in the prototype and expanding the functionality to better fit our requirements, at this point being around Weeks 9/10 of Winter term. By the end of Winter term, we will begin work on iteration 2, which will involve putting together virtual machines and databases to cinch the entire project into its fully realized state by week 3 or 4 of Spring term.
