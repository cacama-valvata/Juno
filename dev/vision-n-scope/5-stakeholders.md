# Stakeholders

## Project Partner

Our project partner is team member Casey Colley. Casey is the vice president of OSUSEC and so would utilize this project in an educational or academic setting. Additionally, he is the captain of one of the A&D teams and would use this to help train the team for competitions. As part of the development team, he is also responsible for organizing the team, developing some portions of the software, and bridging communications between the team and the class itself (TAs, instructors, expected classwork and deadlines).

## Financial Contact

Our dedicated financial contact for the team will be Arian Ghorbani. Arian is in charge of identifying the capital needs of the project, identifying potential and best solutions to these needs, researching cost demonstrations, and presenting this information for capital requests. Arian will also be the financial point of contact with the university accountant and class organizers.

## Development Team

Every member of the development team is a cybersecurity student and a member of OSUSEC. The developers of the project are also the end-users of the project. The team is responsible for designing, building, and verifying the system. 

## Faculty Advisor

Our faculty advisor for this project is Dr. Yeongjin Jang. Like other cybersecurity professors, Yeongjin would be able to use this project to host and deploy games for educational value. He is also responsible for providing guidance to the development team on both the technical implementation of the project and the iteration plan.

## OSUSEC

OSU's Security Club is the primary intended audience for this project. They compete in hosted games which provides practice with managing real world cyber-threats. They will be able to use this project to host practices for these competitions.

## Cybersecurity Instructors

Cybersecurity instructors have a responsibility to teach their students skills that are transferrable outside of class. Instructors would be able to use this project to provide hands-on experience with class topics.

## Cybersecurity Professionals

Cybersecurity professionals would be able to deploy custom environments which can be leveraged to educate and train an Incident Response team on modern security vulnerabilities. It can also be used by vulnerability researchers to test new Attack Chains that they are developing.
