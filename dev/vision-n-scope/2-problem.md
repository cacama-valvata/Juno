# Problem Statement

Orchestrating the unique and vulnerable networks for A&D requires a significant amount of resources - each competition that is held is generally only held annually. The designer needs access to enough computing resources to host the network and machines during the development process. And as discussed above, the actual design of the environment has many dependencies and considerations to keep track of. While these cybersecurity games are very valuable as learning opportunities and test laboratories for both students and professional teams alike, the time and effort required to design environments is a prohibitive cost for all but the most dedicated.
