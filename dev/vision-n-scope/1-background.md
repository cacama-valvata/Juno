# Background

Whether for profit or for fun, the cybersecurity community’s favorite pastime is hacking games. It is general consensus in the community that the best way to learn how to defend against Threat Actors is to learn how to implement their exploits yourself and then to get the hands-on experience defending against those exploits. Games provide that experience in a safe, controlled, and legal environment. These games generally take one of two forms: Jeopardy-style or Attack & Defense. In Jeopardy-style games, teams attempt to hack into the organizers’ infrastructure. In Attack & Defense games, teams are tasked with attacking other teams’ networks while defending their own. Jeopardy-style games already have numerous existing frameworks for rapid deployment, such as CTFd and Kubernetes. The format inherently lends itself well to deploying at scale: challenges are simple, ephemeral, and isolated from each other.

On the other hand, Attack & Defense games require more sophisticated systems to deploy environments, because each team needs a network of full virtual machines. In addition, the environments are more complicated to create—each network must host a dozen persistent, interdependent services. Because teams are going head to head, the machines must also be exploitable for a wide range of skill levels. Designing networks to fit these constraints can be incredibly time-consuming.
